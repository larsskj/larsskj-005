An LED tester for larsskj-003 boards
====================================

### larsskj-005

This board can be used to test LEDs connected to my larsskj-003 boards. It uses a NSI50010YT1G CCR (Constant Current Regulator) to source the LEDs with around 10 mA no matter the supply voltage.

SMD resistors may be used instead.
